## Hi there! :octocat:

Those are my dotfiles, I'm trying to keep it simple, and I hope you find something useful here. ^^

I had a lot of trouble using Arch, so lets have new troubles with nix, hehehe, hehe, he, h,...
I really hope that reproducible builds helps with my needs of rolling back my machine.

### TODO
- Remove or move flake-parts
- Add options to control nix-modules
